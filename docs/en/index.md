  <p class="custom-container-title">🌟 Exploring the New AI Era</p>
  <p>In this era of rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, we are witnessing the deep integration of technology and education. Unlike human children's growth, AI's evolution is astonishing—achieving in months what takes humans years of cognitive development. This unprecedented rapid iteration compels us to seriously consider how to address this transformation in education.</p>
</div>

## Foreword

<div class="custom-container info">
  <p>This guide, born from reflections on this transformative era and co-created with AI, aims to inspire everyone exploring the path of AI education. We need to rethink the essence of education: what skills should we cultivate in students when AI capabilities rapidly surpass humans in certain areas? How can education keep pace with AI development?</p>
</div>

This is both a contemplation of the future and an exploration of knowledge. Here, we discuss how to redefine learning in the AI era, how to make technology an effective assistant in knowledge acquisition, and how to find the optimal balance in human-machine collaboration.
