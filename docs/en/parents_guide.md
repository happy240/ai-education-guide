# Special Discussion: Educational Reflections in the AI Era

### 1. What Kind of Talent Does Future Society Need?

#### Why Must We Focus on AI Education Now?
For the first time in educational history, we face this challenge: AI's learning and evolution speed far exceeds that of human children. An AI model can master knowledge and skills in months that would take humans decades to learn. This unprecedented development speed is reshaping the essence and goals of education. We must seriously consider:
- What core competencies should we cultivate in children when AI rapidly masters and surpasses human abilities in certain areas?
- How can educational methods adapt to this era of rapid AI iteration?
- Against the background of continuous AI evolution, what are the truly eternal human advantages?

#### Core Capability Transformation
Traditional education emphasized abilities:
- Knowledge memorization and reproduction
- Basic calculation ability
- Standardized problem-solving ability
- Execution ability following fixed processes

Abilities valued in the AI era:
- Creative thinking
- Critical thinking
- Cross-disciplinary integration ability
- Problem definition ability
- AI collaboration ability
- Information discrimination ability
- Lifelong learning ability

#### New Professional Literacy
1. Digital Literacy:
   - Understanding AI tools' advantages and limitations
   - Effectively using AI to improve work efficiency
   - Data analysis and interpretation ability

2. Humanistic Literacy:
   - Empathy and emotional intelligence
   - Cross-cultural communication ability
   - Value judgment ability

3. Innovation Ability:
   - Discovering and defining problems
   - Designing innovative solutions
   - Cross-domain knowledge integration

### 2. Transformation of Educational Goals

#### Traditional Educational Goals

```

### 3. Potential Risks of Not Emphasizing AI Application Ability

#### Career Development Risks
According to the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 "Future of Jobs Report"[^1], by 2030, 22% of global jobs will undergo structural transformation. About 92 million existing jobs will be replaced while creating 170 million new positions. Not mastering AI application abilities will face serious career development risks.

1. Decreased Employment Competitiveness:
   WEF reports that by 2030, 39% of existing skills will be obsolete or need transformation. Employees without AI application abilities will be disadvantaged in:
   - Work efficiency lower than AI-proficient colleagues, as AI and big data have become the fastest-growing core skills
   - Unable to adapt to AI-assisted work environments, 50% of enterprises plan to restructure business for AI development
   - Missing new career opportunities created by AI, technology-related positions (like big data experts, fintech engineers, AI specialists) will be the fastest-growing positions

2. Career Ceiling:
   Reports show 85% of enterprises prioritize employee reskilling, 70% plan to recruit employees with new skills:
   - Limited to AI-replaceable work, clerical and secretarial work will see the largest decline
   - Difficulty in undertaking innovative work, analytical and creative thinking have become core skills most valued by enterprises
   - Limited career development space, 40% of enterprises plan to reduce employees with irrelevant skills

#### Learning Ability Risks
1. Low Knowledge Acquisition Efficiency:
   - Unable to utilize AI for rapid learning:
   Education scholars believe that with the enhancement of artificial intelligence capabilities, humans face a "serious risk" of "disconnected education, decoupled from the future." Our learning motivation might weaken, and we might even lose reading and writing abilities as these skills become unnecessary for many in daily life, leading to inability to utilize AI for rapid learning. Like in university classrooms, some students overly rely on AI, completely copying AI-generated content, losing opportunities for independent thinking and creation, thus unable to truly utilize AI for efficient knowledge acquisition[^2]
   - Limited information processing ability
   - Outdated learning methods

2. Cognitive Limitations:
   - Fixed thinking patterns
   - Limited innovation ability
   - Weak problem-solving ability

#### Social Adaptation Risks
1. Digital Divide:
   - Increasing gap with digital natives
   - Decreased social participation
   - Reduced opportunity access ability

2. Resource Utilization:
   - Unable to enjoy AI-brought conveniences
   - Increased resource acquisition costs
   - Low decision-making efficiency

## Part One: Understanding AI Technology
### What is AI?
- AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a computer system simulating human intelligence
- Common AI applications include: ChatGPT, intelligent education apps, online learning assistants
- AI can assist learning but cannot completely replace traditional education methods

#### Practical Case Analysis
Taking ChatGPT as an example:
1. As a Math Teacher:
   - Can explain problem-solving steps in detail
   - Provides multiple solution approaches
   - Example: When solving a math application problem, AI not only gives answers but explains thinking processes

2. As a Language Assistant:
   - Helps understand article meanings
   - Analyzes writing techniques
   - Example: When reading classical poetry, AI can explain word meanings and analyze writing methods

3. As a Knowledge Encyclopedia:
   - Answers various knowledge questions
   - Provides extended learning materials
   - Example: When children are interested in scientific phenomena, AI can explain principles in simple terms

### AI Technology Advantages and Limitations
