## Part One: Understanding AI from an Educator's Perspective

### 1. AI Technical Principles and Educational Applications

#### Deep Learning Fundamentals
```text
1. Core Concepts:
   - Neural Networks: Simulating brain-like information processing
   - Deep Learning: Feature extraction through multi-layer networks
   - Large Language Models: Processing and generating natural language

2. Training Process:
   - Data collection and preprocessing
   - Model architecture design
   - Parameter optimization and adjustment
   - Performance evaluation and validation

3. Application Characteristics:
   - Parallel Computing: Processing multiple tasks simultaneously
   - Pattern Recognition: Discovering data patterns
   - Probabilistic Reasoning: Generating most likely answers
```

#### AI Learning Characteristics

Unlike traditional computer programs, AI systems have the following characteristics:

1. Data-Driven Learning
- Training through large-scale data
- Automatic feature and pattern extraction
- Continuous optimization and improvement

2. Rapid Iteration Updates
- Training speed far exceeds human learning
- Real-time knowledge updates
- Continuous performance improvement

3. Generalization Ability
- Applying learned knowledge to new scenarios
- Handling unseen problems
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer

#### AI Limitations in Educational Applications

1. Depth of Understanding
- AI lacks true comprehension ability
- Based on statistical models rather than real understanding
- May generate superficially reasonable but substantively incorrect answers
- Lacks causal reasoning ability

2. Creative Ability
- Limited creative capabilities
- Content based on recombination of existing data
- Difficulty in generating truly original content
- Requires human guidance and review

3. Educational Value
- Has limitations in education
- Cannot replace teacher's emotional guidance
- Lacks value and moral judgment
- May affect students' independent thinking ability
